# go-actransit
Simple library for interfacing with the Alameda Contra-Costa Transit api: http://api.actransit.org/

Currently supports getting stops and getting stop next arrival predictions.

This is by no means complete (and is subject to changes for a while).

## Install

```
go get github.com/ianmdawson/go-actransit
```
